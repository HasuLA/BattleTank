# BattleTank

### Concept
* An open world head-to-head tank fight with very simple AI, terrain, and simple control system in Unreal Engine 4
* The terrain will be used for tactical advantage
### Rules
* You can move anywhere in the terrain, which is surrounded by mountains
* Both players start with finite health and ammo
* Each direct hit takes away health
* The last player standing wins

This is a study project from Ben Tristem's Unreal Enigne course.
